# Data types in Types script

## Built in data types:

| s.no | DataType  |                     Description                     |
| :--: | :-------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|  1   |  number   |        has all numbers including float, int         |
|  2   |  string   |            has all character and strings            |
|  3   |  boolean  |               has only true or false                |
|  4   |    any    |        this is super type of all data types         |
|      |           |                                                     |
|  5   |   void    |       used in functions that return no values       |
|  6   |   null    | represents an intentional absent of an object value |
|  7   | undefined | denotes values given to all uninitialized variable  |

_Note_ : There is no integer datatype in TypeScript and JavaScript

### Null and undefined â”€ Are they the same?

    - The null and the undefined datatypes are often a source of confusion. The null and undefined cannot be used to reference the data type of a variable. They can only be assigned as values to a variable.
    - However, null and undefined are not the same. A variable initialized with undefined means that the variable has no value or object assigned to it while null means that the variable has been set to an object whose value is undefined.

## User defined data types:

| s.no | DataType  |                Description                 |
| :--: | :-------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|  1   |  arrays   | similar to python list and arrays in c/c++ |
|  2   |   Enums   |                enumeration                 |
|  3   |  classes  |                                            |
|  3   | interface |           has only true or false           |
